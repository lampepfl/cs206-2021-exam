## Exercise

Word2vec is a well-known technique in natural language processing that creates
vector representations of words [^1]. As input, it requires calculating word
n-gram frequencies of the corpus text. A word n-gram is a size n tuple of words
that appear together in the text. For instance, the sentence "Are you awake,
Romeo" corresponds to following word 3-grams: `("are", "you", "awake")`,
`("you", "awake", "romeo")`. [^2]

In this exercise, you will use Spark to calculate n-gram frequencies (with n=3)
from Shakespeare's plays.

You are given the `NGrams` class, which already contains a (buggy) function to
create n-grams from the text, as well as a function to locally calculate their
frequencies.

Your tasks will be:

- [TASK 1], [TASK 2] - fix the bugs in the function that turns text into n-grams.
- [TASK 3] - calculate n-gram frequencies in a distributed manner.
- [TASK 4], [TASK 5] - calculate speaker-specific (remember, those are theatre
  plays) n-gram frequencies

You can find more detailed descriptions of the tasks in the `NGrams` class.

### Footnotes

[^1]: Interestingly, you can perform vector arithmetic on such representations.
    `Brother - Man + Woman` produces a vector closest to `Sister`. If you're
    interested, the Wikipedia Word2Vec
    [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec) isn't the worst place to
    start reading about the topic, and it cites related work.
    
[^2]: typically, we'd consider permutations of these n-grams as well. For this
    exercise this won't be the case, since it only makes understanding test
    output more complicated without really adding anything to the problem.
