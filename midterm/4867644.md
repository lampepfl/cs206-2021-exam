## Exercise

In this exercise, you will implement an array Combiner using internally a doubly linked list of arrays. Your goal is to complete the implementation of the (simplified) Combiner interface, by implementing the `result` method to compute the result array from this array combiner.

Here you can see the declaration of the `DLLCombiner` class and the related `Node` class definition. Look at the `Lib` trait in the `lib.scala` file to find all definitions of relevant functions and classes.


```scala
  class Node(val size: Int) {
    var value: Array[Int] = new Array(size)
    var next: Node = null
    var previous: Node = null
    var cnt = 0

    def add(v: Int) = {
      value(cnt) = v
      cnt += 1
    }
  }

  // Simplified Combiner interface
  // Implements methods += and combine
  // Abstract methods should be implemented in subclasses
  abstract class DLLCombiner(val chunk_size: Int)
```

`DLLCombiner` class contains the implementation of methods `+=` and `combine`. You should look at them to better understand the structure of this array Combiner, before moving on to solving this exercise.

Your task in the exercise will be to implement the `result` method of the `DLLCombinerImplementation` class. This method should compute the result array from this array combiner. This method should work in parallel according to the Combiner contract. Implement this method efficiently using 4 parallel tasks, by copying the doubly linked list to the array from both ends at the same time. Two threads should start from the start of the list and two from the end. In each case, one thread would be responsible for odd list indexes and the other for even ones.


```scala
  class DLLCombinerImplementation(chunk_size: Int = 3) extends DLLCombiner(chunk_size) {

    // Computes every other Integer element of data array, starting from the second, up to the middle
    def task1(data: Array[Int]) = task {
      ???
    }

    // Computes every other Integer element of data array, starting from the first (index 0), up to the middle
    def task2(data: Array[Int]) = task {
      ???
    }

    // Computes every other Integer element of data array, starting from the last, up to the middle
    def task3(data: Array[Int]) = task {
      ???
    }

    // Computes every other Integer element of data array, starting from the second to last, up to the middle
    // This is executed on the current thread.
    def task4(data: Array[Int]) = {
      ???
    }

    def result(): Array[Int] = {
      val data = new Array[Int](cnt)

      ???

      data
    }

  }
```

Following the description above, your task in the exercise is to:

- Implement the four tasks to copy parts of the array. Each task is responsible for computing one quarter of the array, as indicated in comments:
    + Task 1: Computes every other Integer element of data array, starting from the second, up to the middle
    + Task 2: Computes every other Integer element of data array, starting from the first (index 0), up to the middle
    + Task 3: Computes every other Integer element of data array, starting from the last, up to the middle
    + Task 4: Computes every other Integer element of data array, starting from the second to last, up to the middle
- Implement the method `result` to compute the result array in parallel using those four tasks.

Hints:

- Note that this doubly linked list implementation uses `null` pointers to represent the absence of nodes. Be careful when working with `null` pointers in your solution, to avoid causing a `NullPointerException`.

- `DLLCombinerImplementation` comes with a private `copyForward` method that you can use in your solution:

```scala
  private def copyForward(data: Array[Int], curr: Node, from: Int, to: Int, limit: Int)
```

This method copies certain elements from a doubly linked list to an array, in a way that might be useful for this exercise.

## Examples

Here is one example of the `result` method with intermediate results:

```scala
    val combiner1 = DLLCombinerImplementation(4)
    combiner1 += 7 // (7)
    combiner1 += 2 // (7, 2)
    combiner1 += 4 // (7, 2, 4)
    combiner1 += 3 // (7, 2, 4, 3)
    combiner1 += 9 // (7, 2, 4, 3) <-> (9)
    combiner1 += 5 // (7, 2, 4, 3) <-> (9, 5)
    combiner1 += 1 // (7, 2, 4, 3) <-> (9, 5, 1)

    val res1 = combiner1.result() // (7, 2, 4, 3, 9, 5, 1)

```
In this example, `task1` was responsible for computing elements at index 1, `task2` for computing elements at indexes 0 and 2, `task3` for computing elements at indexes 6 and 4, and `task4` for computing elements at indexes 5 and 3.

Here is another example with combining:

```scala
    val c1 = DLLCombinerImplementation(4)
    c1 += 7 // (7)
    c1 += 2 // (7, 2)
    c1 += 4 // (7, 2, 4)
    c1 += 3 // (7, 2, 4, 3)
    c1 += 9 // (7, 2, 4, 3) <-> (9)
    c1 += 5 // (7, 2, 4, 3) <-> (9, 5)
    c1 += 1 // (7, 2, 4, 3) <-> (9, 5, 1)

    val c2 = DLLCombinerImplementation(4)
    c2 += 6 // (6)
    c2 += 8 // (6, 8)
    c2 += 5 // (6, 8, 5)
    c2 += 1 // (6, 8, 5, 1)

    val c3 = DLLCombinerImplementation(4)
    c3 += 1 // (1)

    c1.combine(c2).combine(c3) // (7, 2, 4, 3) <-> (9, 5, 1) <-> (6, 8, 5, 1) <-> (1)
    val res = c1.result() // (7, 2, 4, 3, 9, 5, 1, 6, 8, 5, 1, 1)

```

You can look at the public tests to find more examples.

In your solution you should only make changes to the `DLLCombinerImplementation` class. You are not allowed to change the file `lib.scala`. You can get partial points for solving parts of this exercise.
